        <h4>Jing Mei’s struggles from the overwhelming ambition of her mother’s dreams. Her mother has such a high expectation from her that she feels she can never reach so she doesn’t bother to try at all. She only is able to understand her mother’s perspective after her death when she goes to collect her old piano, only then does she come to the conclusion that she could, if she tried.
        </h4>

        <h4>‘“Why don't you like the way I am? I’m not a genius! I can’t play the piano. And even if I could, I wouldn’t go on TV if you paid me a million dollars!” My mother slapped me “Who ask you to be genius?” she shouted. “Only ask you be your best. For you sake.”’</h4>
