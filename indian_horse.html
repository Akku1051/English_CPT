        <h4>Saul, unlike Macbeth, is able to cope eventually. He is so permanently scarred by the residential school, St Jermoes, that he is unable to mentally process it. He uses hockey and alcohol as forms of escapism, which only leads him to be more miserable. Only when he confronts his traumas by returning to St Jeromes can he start to heal. </h4>

        <h4>“When your innocence is stripped from you, when your people are denigrated, when the family you come from is denounced and your tribal ways and rituals are pronounced backwards, primitive, savage, you come to see yourself as less human. That’s hell on earth, the sense of unworthiness. That’s what they inflicted on us.” - (Wagamese, pg 81)</h4>

        <h4>“The drink snared me. I spoke less and drank more, and I became the Indian again; drunken and drooling and reeling, a caricature everyone sought to avoid,” - (Wagamese, pg 181)</h4>

        <h4>‘“We’re not responsible for what happened to us. None of us are.” Fred said. “But our healing- that’s up to us. That’s what saved me. Knowing it was my game.”’ - (Wagamese, pg 210)</h4>
